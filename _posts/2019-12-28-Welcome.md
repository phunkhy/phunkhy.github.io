This blog is dedicated to music production on an iPad. While my workflows might sometimes includes a laptop, for sure the iPad is in the center and I try to do things on the iPad as much as possible. Why someone wants to limit his tooling to a mobile device with quite limited screen real estate and CPU and memory contraints? 

It all started in 2019 when I installed Garage Band on my first iPad and I was surprised how well it worked and how capable it was. The more I used it to make music the more I noticed that it lets my focus more on the music because I could neither install hundreds of synths and plugins nor using more than a few at once. I tend to rather record than to edit. Moreover I was suddenly so mobile as I do not need much more than the iPad, headphones and my Korg nanoKeys to make music whereever I go.

Anyway I bought some more hardware as it is much nicer to turn a real knob. My current hardware:

- iPad 9.7 5th gen 32 GB on iPadOS 13
- Korg nanoKeys Studio Bluetooth MIDI controller
- Novation Launchpad Mini Mk II
- Novation LaunchControl XL
- Apple Camera Connection Kit (USB and Lightning for power)
- Superlux HD 681 Evo headphones ([amazon](https://amzn.to/2Q5ZnGq))
- Sandisk Ultra 128 GB USB dongle ([amazon](https://amzn.to/2Zu6eN4))
- TP-Link powered USB-hub ([amazon](https://amzn.to/2SxHYbd))
- Lamicall Gooseneck Tablet Holder ([amazon](https://amzn.to/37fiVOm))
