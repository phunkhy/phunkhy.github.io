## Phunkhy Beats!

The idea to start the blog came when I wanted to note down what I found out to memorize it for myself. The same thing I already did for my programming. When I discover something noteworthy why just note it for yourself? Why not share with world? So, that's the reason for this blog. I'll try to structure it with meaningful tags. To be able to easily explain a specific setup I'm using [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) which is a diagramming tool that I learned to love for software development.

## About Me

I was a computer geek from the age of 14 back in the golden age of home computers and I very early liked electronic music like Kraftwerk or Klaus Schulze. I got my first computer in 1983 ([Atari 800](http://oldcomputers.net/atari800.html)) and my first synthesizer in 1984 ([Korg 770](http://www.vintagesynth.com/korg/770.php)). I never learned an instrument except Djembe drumming but in 1987 my best friend spent the money he inherited on building up a home recording studio. And I was responsible for the computer and synth equipment: [Atari ST](http://oldcomputers.net/atari520st.html) running [Cubase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPXAVGizQSY) (MIDI only), [Kawai K1](http://www.vintagesynth.com/kawai/kawaik1.php) wavetable synth and a [Roland R8](http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/r8.php) drum machine. We spent countless days and nights in that studio creating tracks, recording musicians. Then in the early 1990s techno music came into my life and heavily influenced me. The Atari ST was then replaced by a PC running Cubase Audio (with audio tracks) and a Turtle Beach Tropez sound card (hosting a synth capable to play sf2 soundfonts).

As a student of computer science I developed MIDI software, e.g. an editor and bank manager for the Prophet VS. After I graduated I focused more on software development and started a carreer in the software industry. When my first child was born my time was very limited and music making was reduced to drumming my Djembe with friends sometimes. But now, almost 20 years later, the iPad brought back the fun and I think that I started a really interesting journey.
